# Pyber Plot Project Objectives
---
## Build a Bubble Plot showcasing the relationship between four key variables:
* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

## Produce the following three pie charts:
* Percent of Total Fares by City Type
* Percent of Total Rides by City Type
* Percent of Total Drivers by City Type

# Observations and Results
---
* Rural areas have fewer rides and drivers, but riders pay more. Urban areas have more rides and drivers, but riders pay less.

* In rural areas it is likely that the distance between locations is greater which means longer car rides. And urban areas it make sense that since locations are more clustered the car rides will be quicker.

* The suburb is interestingly average.

* With regards to total fares, total rides, and total drivers; urban areas take the lead in all three, followed by suburban areas, then lastly, rural areas.
